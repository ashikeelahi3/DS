# STATISTICS FOR DATA SCIENCE

## DAY 0 (BASIC)

### What is Statistics?

*Statistics* is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data for batter *decision making.*

### There are two main areas of statistics

1. **Descriptive Statistics:**  collection, presentation, and description of sample data.
2. **Inferential Statistics:** making decisions and drawing conclusions about populations

### Basic Terms

**Population(N):** A collection, or set, of individuals or objects or events whose elements have a characteristic in common.
*There are two kinds of populations: finite or infinite.*

**Sample(n):** A representative subset of the population.

**Variable:** A characteristic about each individual element of a population or sample.

**Data (singular):** The value of the variable associated with one element of a population or sample. This value may be a number, a word, or a symbol.

**Data (plural):** The set of values collected for the variable from each of the elements belonging to the sample.

*Facts or piece of information that can be measured is called data.*

**Experiment:** A planned activity whose results yield a set of data.

**Parameter:** An unknown numerical value summarizing all the data of an entire population.

**Statistic:** A numerical value summarizing the sample data.

### Most commonly used sampling Techniques

1. **Simple random sampling** (Most of the time used)

    Every member of the population(N) has an equal chance of being selected for sample (n)
2. **Stratified Sampling:**

    Where the population(N) is split into non-overlapping group.

    *Ex1: Gender: Male -> Female*

    *Ex2: Age: (0-10) -> (20-40) -> (20-40) -> (40-100)*

3. **Systematic Sampling:**
    (N) -> nth interval

    *Ex: Collecting data form every 5th observation*

4. **Convenience Sampling:**
    Only these people who are interested in the survey.

### Types of Variable

1. **Qualitative variable / Categorical variable:**  Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are not meaningful.

    i) **Nominal variable:** categorize only by names.

    ii) **Ordinal variable:** Name with ordered position or ranking

2. **Quantitative variable / Numerical variable:** Measured numerically

    i) **Discrete variable:** Whole number (isolated points along a line interval)

    ii) **Continuous variable:** Any values (integer, decimal) [*any value along a line interval, including every possible value between any two values*]

### There are 4 different scale of measurement of a variable

1. **Nominal:** identified only by name
2. **Ordinal:** tell you  the direction of difference between two individuals.
3. **Interval:**

    i) identify the direction and magnitude of a difference;

    ii) Zero is not true zero (0 degree C does not say that there is no temperature)

    iii) Addition and subtraction can be calculated, but multiplication and division are meaningless.

4. **Ratio:**

    i) identify the direction and magnitude of differences and allow ratio comparisons of measurements.

    ii) Zero is true zero.

    iii) Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are meaningful.

### Source of Data

1. **Primary Data:** collected by investigator
2. **Secondary Data:** collected by others (2nd hand data)
